## üöÄ The Problem

I built this project to solve a personal frustration. Every semester, planning my university's FFCS (Fully Flexible Credit System) timetable was a nightmare of pen, paper, and constant erasing. I'd try to juggle multiple "perfect" schedules, only to find a slot clash or realize I'd accidentally scheduled classes straight through my lunch break.

It was tedious, time-consuming, and easy to make mistakes.

**This tool is the solution.** It's a simple, visual scheduler that digitizes the entire process, automates clash detection, and reduces the time and effort of creating a perfect schedule from hours to minutes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Visual Grid:** Click any slot on the weekly timetable to select it for a course.
* **Multi-Course Planning:** Add up to 10 different courses and assign slots to each one individually.
* **Automatic Slot Clash Detection:** The app prevents you from selecting the same slot for two different courses.
* **Intelligent Lunch Break Protection:** This is the most important feature! The app understands the FFCS lunch break (1:10 PM - 1:15 PM) and **prevents you from selecting *both* the pre-lunch and post-lunch slots** on the same day (e.g., C11 and A21 on Monday), ensuring you always have time to eat.
* **Selected Slots Summary:** Get a clean, at-a-glance view of all the slots you've chosen for each course.
* **Download as Image:** Instantly save a PNG screenshot of your final timetable to your device using the "Download" button.
* **Sleek, Responsive UI:** A modern "cosmic" theme that's easy to use on both desktop and mobile.
